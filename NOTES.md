 # React Notes                                                                          

# Basics:   
Q✍️ . Create Hello World Program using only HTML 

Q✍️ . Create Hello World Program using Javascript 

Q✍️ . What is crossorigin in Content Delivery  Networks  (CDN) Links   
      Crossorigin:  
                The crossorigin attribute in the script tag enables Cross-Origin  Resource Sharing (CORS) for loading 
          external JavaScript files from a  different origin than the hosting web page. This allows the script to 
          access resources from the server hosting the script, such as making  HTTP requests or accessing data. 

Q✍️ . To make our app Production ready what should we do? 

      1. Minify our file (Remove console logs, bundle things up) 
      2. Need a server to run things

      Minify —> Optimization —>Clean console —> Bundle 

      * Bundlers: 
        In React, to get external functionalities, we use Bundlers. It  packages your app properly so it can be shipped to production. Examples: 
        1. Webpack 
        2. vite 
        3. Parcel 

        In create-react-app, the bundler used is webpack 

        * Package Manager: 
            Bundlers are packages. If we want to use a package in our code,  we have to use a package manager.  
            We use a package manager known as npm or yarn 
        * npm: 
            npm doesn’t mean node package manager but everything else.
